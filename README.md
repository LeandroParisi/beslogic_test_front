# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

1) Clone this repository

2) npm install

3) npm start

*: I know it's not a good practice to leave .env vars on repos, but I did it so that it would be easier for you to test
